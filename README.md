# Speech Recognition

Speech recognition using [web speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) and recording the audio using [the mediaStream recording API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API)

[Demo](https://speech-recognition-umber.vercel.app/)

> Note: The pace in changing speech to text depends on internet connection because on some browsers, like Chrome, using Speech Recognition on a web page involves a server-based recognition engine. Your audio is sent to a web service for recognition processing, so it won't work offline. Read more [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition)
